A fork of flask-themes with a few differences:

- updated for recent flask versions

- integrates resources with webassets/flask-assets

- yaml config files for themes, with greater flexibility in config file specification

TODO:

- refactor the directory parsing kludge of the bundling/resource registry

- provide fallback theme for render_template, then fallback to local templates

suggestions/input appreciated
