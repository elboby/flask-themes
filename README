Fleem

forked from flask-themes with a few differences:

- updated to integrate with recent flask versions

- integrates resources with webassets/flask-assets

TODO:

- refactor the directory parsing kludge of the bundling/resource registry

- A tag similar to the webassets that would handle resolving the current themes resources

    e.g.

    {% assets "current_theme_js" %}
        <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ ASSET_URL }}"></script>
    {% endassets %}

suggestions/input appreciated
